### Imp for Git

Names of the remote and local branches should be same so you will encounter lesser problems

##### 1. Fetch all updates from the remote
git fetch origin

##### 2. Prune deleted remote branches
git remote prune origin


##### 3. Set upstream branch for your local branch
git push --set-upstream origin feature-branch
