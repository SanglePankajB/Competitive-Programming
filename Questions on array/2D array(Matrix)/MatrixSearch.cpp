// QUESTION: 
// How to search the target from the matrix while matrix is sorted?

// ******** If matrix is sorted then we can apply some logic but if not so then we are gonna need to perform brut force i.e, seach every element from the matrix and check if it is present or not. *******

    // What we want is we shouldn't go outside the columns and rows so add the parameters in while loop right.
    // we can not use for loop cause for loop works one after anothe element and here we are traversing according to our element (üê• But we can use for loop in bruteForce approach cause we are gonna go throgh all elements in that.üê•)
