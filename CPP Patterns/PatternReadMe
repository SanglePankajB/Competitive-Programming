Rules :
1. In the o/p pattern or any loop flows from left to right.

2. One row can only be ended when we add line break "endl".

3. That means we can print multiple things on one single line.

4. e.g for spaces in the first one loop inside main row's loop (i loop) and then second loop for printing "*"  and when your imaginary row ends you end row by cout<<endl;.
